Hey Pranay,

I am so excited to meet today. Thanks for scheduling
this super fun date through ember - don't they just have the best logo!

Also, for the study session, I cannot come on next Tuesday. However, the 28th will work. 5:00 PM, 5:30 PM, or 6 PM should be okay.

P.S. I don't know what Tyler's deal is, but he's really been screwing everyone
over in the data science hackerspace.

Best,
Austin
